## Inside This Project

It's my static website front end practice so it wouldn't have much function and database. Main function in this project are fetching and adding data from JSON file to HTML file. Another are previous/next page action on button click, and accept quest alert in Quests page.

The challenge is this community has a lot of data which important for player to read and understand. And the data are not in the same pattern depend on each class so I've must design JSON and JavaScript function to add all the data to HTML file depend on each class too.

In future, I'd like to make it dynamic website that admin can edit data and not have to deal with the code. Also add some features such as Login/Register, Accept/Report Quest, Get/Add items in the Stockpile, Items Select page, etc.

### HTML files

All the HTML files have navigation bar and footer in common and section at the center will be the content of the website.

### CSS files

There is 1 CSS file name style.css. I've used it along with Bootstrap 5 to make teal neon and futuristic design for the website.

### JavaScript

There is 1 JavaScript file name script.js. I've used it to fetch data from JSON file and add content to html automatically. Another function in the script are previous/next page button and alertbox for Quests page.

### JSON

There are 2 JSON files that contain data of each class and agent's NPC.
